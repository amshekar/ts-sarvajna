I am excited to present to you an omniscient app that can answer all your questions. This app is powered by a state-of-the-art large language model called LlAMa, which is based on the GPT architecture.

In this presentation, we will cover the following topics:

Overview of the Ts-sarvajna team and their involvement
How the app works
Benefits of using the app
Overview of LlAMa

Let's get started.

## Overview of the Ts-sarvajna team and their involvement

The Ts-sarvajna team has been involved in the development of the omniscient app. They have contributed custom data to train the LlAMa model, which allows it to answer a wide range of questions with a high degree of accuracy.

## How the app works

The app works by using the LlAMaIndex (GPT Index) to connect the LlAMa model with external data. This allows the model to answer a wide range of questions with a high degree of accuracy. To use the app, 
  
  Copy or drop the custom knowledge base like confluence,share point documents or  any unstrustured data of knowledge base files like ppt,pdf,.txt,chats,html etc..
  under data folder
  Train the model with our custom data the app will fine tune the model with updated knowledge base 
  use the  index and ask the questions
  If the documents/content  gets updated fine tune model and as the questions
  
simply input your question and wait for the model to generate an answer.

## Benefits of using the app

There are many benefits to using the omniscient app. For example:

It can save you time and effort by providing quick answers to your questions.
It can help you learn new things by providing accurate and detailed information.
It can improve your productivity by allowing you to focus on more important tasks.

## Overview of LlAMa 

LlAMa is a state-of-the-art large language model based on the GPT architecture. Specifically, it is a fine-tuned version of the GPT-3 model, which can run on your local computer. LlamaHub.ai provides a central interface in the form of a custom indexing system called LlamaIndex (GPT Index), which enables you to connect your large language models with external data. This allows you to index your data for various tasks, such as text generation, summarization, question answering, and more.

In conclusion, the omniscient app powered by LlAMa is a powerful tool that can answer all your questions. It is easy to use and provides accurate information, thanks to the Ts-sarvajna team's contributions and the LlamaHub.ai platform. If you have any questions, I highly recommend giving the app a try. Thank you.
Its an Omniscient app which answer all your questions
